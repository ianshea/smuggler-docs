I really suck at these. Added in the Economy Attributes, but pivoting to a more physical/tangible wealth system that fits the overall game better.

Here’s the state of things at a glance:

**Solid (green)**

- **Flow System** (GameInstanceSubsystem) with phases + LocationDef → clean orchestration across screens/maps; scalable to many locations.
    
- **UI stack** (HUD + push/pop screens) → payload-driven screens will slot right in.
    
- **GAS core** (ASC, Vitals, Mana) → abilities/costs/cooldowns already proven.
    
- **Inventory** using **PrimaryAssetId** (+ non-stackable GUID path ready) → type-safe, designer-friendly, saves later without rewrites.
    
- **Item/Asset Manager** wired → resolving names/icons works; Locations registered.
    

**Good but incomplete (yellow)**

- **Portable containers & carry**: design locked (GAS ability + interface/component), not implemented.
    
- **Stations & payload screens**: patterns agreed; InventoryTransfer screen is stub-level.
    
- **Wealth system (tangible)**: item flags/values defined; helpers to total wealth in any inventory ready; no exchange station yet.
    
- **Flow → map spawn tags**: working-ish; minor polish on PlayerStart tags.
    

**Gaps to fill (red-ish, but straightforward)**

- **Save/persistence**: DayIndex + container GUID→contents map + player inventory save.
    
- **Encounter/Checkpoint subsystem**: rules + fines/confiscation tie-in.
    
- **Sequence driver / Day-Night / Weather**: hooks designed, not built.
    

If you do just these next five steps, you’ll see the full loop “click”:

1. **Assayer/Exchange Station (Tower)**
    
    - Input: selected `bIsWealth` items → remove items, mint coin/gem change as needed.
        
    - Output: (if you still want an abstract balance later, you can add it, but for now just items).
        
    - Use your `GetWealthValueOfStacks` to preview totals.
        
2. **Reverse Checkpoint (Encounter stub)**
    
    - On city exit: scan player + carried containers for `Wealth.*`/`Contraband.*`.
        
    - Confiscate on hit or require payment via `TryPay(amount)` once you add it.
        
3. **End-Day screen**
    
    - Show **on-person wealth** (BPFL on player inventory) + **tower chest wealth** (BPFL on chest inventory) + day index.
        
    - Simple summary: “Smuggled out: X; Banked: Y”.
        
4. **Save/Load minimal**
    
    - Save: `DayIndex`, player inventory array, and for each container GUID its contents.
        
    - Load: restore those into the world or player.
        
5. **GA_Carry (Medium portables)**
    
    - Ability activates on focus; drains Mana; UpdateCarry; End → drop or snap into a `SlotComponent`.
        

Tech debt to watch (keep small now, expand later):

- Add an **async** resolve path for item defs if lists get large (to avoid hitching).
    
- Wealth in **nested containers**: extend the BPFL to recurse when the GUID container map is in.
    
- **Error handling/atomic transactions**: when you add TryPay, make item removal + change minting an all-or-nothing call.
    
- If MP ever happens: plan server-authoritative inventory (FastArray) and flow replication.
    

Net: you’ve separated concerns cleanly (Flow, UI, GAS, Inventory, Assets). That’s exactly what makes new mechanics (vendors, bribes, crafting, missions, weather) plug-in work, not rework.
