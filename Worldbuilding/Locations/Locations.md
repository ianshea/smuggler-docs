# Locations

## The Tower (Home Base)

**Biome:** In-between regions (flexible placement)  
**Faction Control:** Enclave property (player "renting" by working off debt)  
**Function:** Production hub, safe haven, progression space  
**Risk Level:** Safe from Kingdom, periodic Enclave "inspections" (inverse checkpoints)

### Features
- Crafting stations (Potion Distiller, Spell Management Station, more to come)
- Storage for contraband/ingredients
- Enclave contact on-site (front shop + hidden Enclave stock)
- Strategic location: Not too close to any major city (safer from scrutiny)

### Vendors
- **Enclave Contact** - Front items + private Enclave stock based on debt compliance/faction standing

### Notes
This is where you return to craft, prepare spells, hide wealth from Enclave inspections, and plan next runs.

### Cultural Vibe
UK-inspired seat of power, bureaucratic, traditional

## Snowmarch (Alpine City)

**Biome:** Alpine mountains  
**Faction Control:** Kingdom-controlled, heavy guard presence  
**Function:** Luxury goods production, wealthy clientele  
**Risk Level:** High - multiple checkpoints, constant patrol

### Primary Exports
- **High-end cheeses** (luxury goods)
- **Premium wines** (vintage quality)
- **Crafted goods** (Swiss-style quality manufacturing)

### Features
- Legal Merchant Quarter (mundane goods, luxury items)

- Kingdom garrison
- Enclave office (official magical enforcement)

### Vendors
- **Legal General Merchant** - Mundane ingredients, luxury legal goods
- **Apothecary** - Legal herbs, some alchemical supplies (grain alcohol, vinegar)
- **Black Market Fence** (hidden contact) - Buyers for contraband, stolen Enclave goods
- **Antiquarian** (wealthy collector) - Pre-prohibition items, rare formulas, pays well for specific goods

### Economic Role
- Luxury goods producer
- High-end contraband market
- Wealthy buyers willing to pay premium

### Notes
This is where you make money but risk is highest. Multiple checkpoints to get in/out. Rich customers mean better prices but also more scrutiny. Perfect for hiding contraband in legitimate luxury cargo (wine barrels, cheese wheels).

## Ashford Crossing (Desert Border Town)

**Biome:** Desert borderlands, war zone with Undead  
**Faction Control:** Contested - officially Kingdom, weak enforcement, rebel presence  
**Function:** War supply hub, scavenger economy, illicit production  
**Risk Level:** Medium - fewer Kingdom guards, but unpredictable/dangerous for other reasons

### Primary Exports
- **War salvage/scavenger goods** (from Undead conflict)
- **"Goose"** - Local moonshine/swill
  - Terrible for drinking
  - Valuable as alchemical reagent/solvent in certain circles
  - Cheap in Ashford, expensive to alchemists elsewhere
- **Super illegal drugs** (desperate border economy)

### Features
- War refugee camps
- Battlefield scavenger markets
- Rebel safe houses (hidden)
- Military supply convoys passing through
- Lawless atmosphere

### Vendors
- **Battlefield Scavenger** - War salvage materials (Death-Touched Steel, Bone Dust, Necrotic Distillate, necromantic components)

  - *Hidden (Faction: Rebels):* Underground goods, bootleg mana extract, rebel-made catalysts
- **Deserter Armorer** - Military contraband (weapons, stimulants)
- **Refugee Trader** - Random inventory, desperate sellers, sometimes good deals

### Economic Role
- War materials sourcing
- Illicit substance production
- Cheap, dangerous goods
- Rebel supply chain hub

### Cultural Vibe
Lawless, desperate, war-torn, morally grey, "do what you must to survive"

### Regional Demand
- Capital alchemists want Goose (reagent) - creates trade route
- Needs basic supplies (food, medicine) - refugee population
- Military wants supplies but also enforcement target

### Faction Access
- **Rebels** faction unlocks Rebel Quartermaster's hidden stock and safe house access

### Notes
Lawless vibe, cheaper goods but less reliable supply. Good for sourcing war materials and necromantic components. Less Kingdom scrutiny but more chaotic/dangerous (bandits, desperate people, war spillover). Perfect for building Rebel faction relationship. Goose creates interesting economic opportunity (cheap here, valuable elsewhere as crafting ingredient).

## Thornhaven (Enclave Stronghold)

**Biome:** TBD (could be anywhere - Enclave chose strategic location)  
**Faction Control:** Enclave headquarters  
**Function:** Source of highest-quality magical goods, bureaucratic/training center  
**Risk Level:** Very High - Enclave security, documentation required, but semi-legitimate access for you

### Features
- Enclave administrative buildings
- Sanctioned alchemical laboratories
- Mage training facilities (restricted)
- Official magical item registry
- Confiscation warehouse (everything Kingdom seizes ends up here)

### Vendors
- **Enclave Supply Office** (Official Requisitions)
  - *Public (requires work permit):* Purified Mana Solution, sanctioned alchemical goods, official reagents
  - *Hidden (Faction: Enclave - high debt compliance):* "Lost" shipments, confiscated goods, military-grade materials at discount (adding to your debt)

- **Archive of Prohibited Materials** (Confiscation Warehouse)
  - *Public:* Not accessible to civilians
  - *Hidden (Faction: Enclave - special jobs):* Entire confiscated contraband warehouse. Everything the Kingdom seizes ends up here. Can "borrow" things if you do jobs for corrupt Enclave officials.

- **Magister's Registry** (Spell Formula Archive)
  - *Public:* Can view catalog of registered formulas (all illegal for civilians)
  - *Hidden (Faction: Enclave):* "Copy" formulas for your own use, steal master-level spell scrolls

### Economic Role
- Premium Enclave goods origin point
- All other Enclave goods are diluted/stolen from here
- Source of highest-quality magical materials
- Spell formula repository

### Cultural Vibe
Bureaucratic, magical authority, grey area operators, "official" but corrupt underneath

### Faction Access
**Enclave faction reputation unlocks:**
- Level 1: Supply office hidden stock (debt-based)
- Level 3: Access confiscation warehouse
- Level 5: Can "borrow" master formulas from Archive

### Notes
Highest risk but highest reward. Being here is almost legitimate (you work for them), but getting caught stealing is catastrophic. This is where premium Enclave goods originate. Ironic that the enforcers of magic prohibition are also the primary producers. Perfect source for rare/powerful items if you can maintain good standing (or pull off heists).
