# World Overview

## Magic Prohibition

### Why Magic is Outlawed

Magic, in the right hands and with proper study, could make people's lives easier and give them the power to craft a utopia. Or burn it all to the ground and murder each other in fits of jealous rage. 

The wise powers that be outlawed magic to prevent both extremes.

### How It's Enforced

Magic prohibition is treated like traffic laws:
- **Minor infractions** (doing a bit of magic, small-scale use) → Warning or fine
- **Major infractions** (causing magical "accidents", concealed high-grade contraband like "a pouch of South Ankorian Pop Lilly pollen hidden by an invisibility spell") → Prison time

It's a varying scale of enforcement depending on severity and who catches you.

### The Reality

This creates the perfect environment for a smuggling economy - magic is illegal but not evil, enforcement is inconsistent, and demand remains high.

## The Undead Crusade

### The Fabricated Crisis

The King and Queen are doing their best in trying times... that they entirely fabricated.

**What Actually Happened:**
- The Undead are usually fine if left alone
- King & Queen wanted a holy crusade to "purge the lands of the undead"
- Necromancers pointed out the never-ending cycle: kill the undead → raise the dead → kill them again → repeat forever
- The King and Queen just didn't really get it
- Crusade happened anyway

### Current State

The Kingdom is now at war with the Undead - a conflict that:
- Didn't need to happen
- Creates a perpetual war economy
- Generates scavenger markets (battlefield salvage)
- Justifies increased Kingdom control and Enclave "assistance"
- Benefits those who profit from war (smugglers, scavengers, arms dealers)

The Undead, for their part, are simply defending themselves from an unprovoked crusade.

## The Enclave

### Official Role

The Enclave operates in a very gray area of Kingdom law as the official magical enforcement authority.

### Shadow Business

Their true heart of business is **dealing in magic** through a distributed network of fronts that obscure their operations.

### Why They Exist

Even the crusade and the Kingdom need magical help sometimes. It's better to have experts at hand who know these things rather than have to reinvent the fireball every time.

The Kingdom can't admit they rely on the Enclave, but they do. The Enclave exploits this dependence by:
- Running the black market for magical goods
- Operating both enforcement AND supply sides
- Creating artificial scarcity to maintain control
- Indebting people (like the player) to work for them

### The Arrangement

The Enclave is tolerated because they're useful. They enforce magic prohibition publicly while dealing magic privately. Everyone in power knows, but no one talks about it.

---

## The Kingdom

### Leadership

The King and Queen rule from the capital plains region. They are:
- Well-intentioned (genuinely trying to do right)
- Terrible at it (fabricated a war, don't understand consequences)
- Bureaucratic (lots of permits, regulations, enforcement)
- Traditional (UK-inspired governance structure)

### Structure

The Kingdom controls most of the land through:
- Central government in the capital
- Regional garrisons and guard posts
- Checkpoints between territories
- Official enforcement of magic prohibition
- Reliance on the Enclave for magical matters (publicly denied)

## Player's Role in the World

### Starting Point

You're not part of any faction initially - you're an independent operator who:
- Took a smuggling job for the Enclave for quick money
- Something went wrong (caught, shipment lost, etc.)
- Now you owe them a massive debt
- Must work it off by running their contraband

### The Trap

You're indebted to the Enclave, which means:
- They supply your ingredients (on credit, adding to debt)
- They expect you to produce contraband for them
- They inspect your operations (inverse checkpoints to ensure you're not skimming)
- They don't care about you - only their investment

### The Goal

**Buy your freedom.** 

Success isn't defeating a final boss or saving the world - it's accumulating enough wealth to:
- Pay off your debt to the Enclave
- Disappear or start a legitimate life
- Escape the smuggling game entirely

You're playing to **get out**, not to gain power or become important. You're a small cog in a much larger world, trying to survive and escape.

## World Themes

### Bureaucratic Overreach
Not grimdark oppression - more **Papers Please** than **1984**. The Kingdom means well but creates problems through incompetence and overregulation.

### Well-Intentioned Incompetence
The King and Queen aren't evil tyrants - they're bad at governance. The crusade wasn't malicious, it was stupid. This creates a more nuanced world.

### Gray Morality
- The Enclave enforces prohibition while profiting from magic
- The Kingdom outlawed something that could help people "for their own good"
- The Undead are victims of an unprovoked war
- Smugglers aren't heroes or villains - they're surviving in a broken system

### Small Player, Big World
You're not the chosen one. You're a specialist in an ecosystem:
- Other people make things you can't
- Other people have access you don't
- Your goal is to escape, not to fix everything
- The world is bigger than your story

## Races & Demographics

### No Race-Based Stereotypes

All races coexist in this world without segregation or race-specific cultures:
- No "elf wine" or "dwarf beer"
- No racial kingdoms or territories
- Races might have historical artifacts or significance, but current culture is mixed
- Regional differences are based on geography/economics, not race

### Cultural Identity

Identity comes from:
- **Location** (where you're from matters more than what you are)
- **Faction** (Kingdom loyalist vs Rebel sympathizer vs Enclave operative)
- **Profession** (smuggler, merchant, soldier, mage)
- **Class** (wealthy alpine merchants vs desperate border refugees)

This creates a more grounded, less tropey fantasy world.
