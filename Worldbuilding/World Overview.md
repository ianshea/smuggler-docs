# World Overview

This is the high-level picture of the world - the essential context that makes everything else make sense.

---

## The Short Version

Hundreds of years ago, the Kingdom fought a long, pointless war with the Undead. When the Undead got tired of the cycle and withdrew, a clever royal claimed credit for "negotiating peace" and used the fabricated treaty to outlaw magic and consolidate power.

Now, generations later, the current royals - who believe the fake history completely - have started a new crusade against an enemy that just wanted to be left alone.

You're a wizard who owes money to the wrong people. You smuggle magical contraband to pay off your debt. Your goal is to escape before the world's dysfunction catches up with you.

## The Prohibition

### The Official Story

The Great Ancestor ended the Undead Wars through masterful diplomacy. The treaty terms included prohibition of magic, which had "caused and prolonged the conflict." The Enclave was established as the regulated magical authority to manage necessary magical functions within the law.

Magic prohibition is the price of peace. It has kept the Kingdom safe for centuries.

### What Actually Happened

The Undead just left.

War is pointless for them - human kills undead, undead kills human, human becomes undead, repeat forever. After generations of this, their leadership (who don't die) realized the humans were never going to figure it out. So they withdrew into isolation and left a note.

The Great Ancestor saw an opportunity:

1. **Declared victory** - Claimed the withdrawal was negotiated surrender
2. **Blamed magic** - "Reckless sorcery caused the war"
3. **Prohibited magic** - Eliminated rival mages and consolidated power
4. **Created the Enclave** - Established a "regulated" magical authority under royal influence
5. **Implemented economic controls** - Monopolies and restrictions dressed up as "treaty obligations"

Over generations, the lie became history. The fabricated treaty became the foundation of the Kingdom's legal and economic order.

### The Enclave Knows

The Enclave has kept records since the beginning. Somewhere in Thornhaven, there's documentation that could unravel the Kingdom's founding mythology.

They don't use it. The current arrangement makes them rich and powerful. Why expose a lie that benefits you?

## The Current War

### The Crusade

The current King and Queen, in their well-intentioned incompetence, decided to launch a holy crusade to "purge the Undead threat."

They genuinely believe:
- The Undead are ancient evil (everyone knows that)
- The Great Ancestor's treaty was real (it's in the history books)
- A crusade is what heroic rulers do (it'll unite the kingdom)

They have no idea they're violating their own ancestor's fiction to attack an enemy that just wants to be left alone.

### The Undead Response

The Undead are defending themselves. Again.

They're not interested in conquest or revenge. They'd stop fighting tomorrow if the Kingdom stopped attacking. But the royals can't admit they made a mistake, so the war continues.

### Economic Disruption

The crusade has cracked open the old system:

| "Treaty Term" | What It Really Was | War Disruption | Your Opportunity |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Necromantic material bans | Eliminated competitors | Battlefields flood market with salvage | Ashford is full of illegal materials |
| Controlled substance monopolies | Crown monopolies on valuable goods | Demand exceeds legal supply | Fuzzy Leaf smuggling, unlicensed production |
| Mana production licensing | Enclave monopoly | Kingdom needs more mana for war | Enclave has leverage; independents have openings |
| Border restrictions | Controlled trade routes | War zones = enforcement gaps | Ashford barely controlled; chaos routes available |
| Knowledge restrictions | Enclave controls formula access | Demand for combat magic | Forbidden scrolls are valuable contraband |

The war is expensive, unpopular, and shows no signs of ending. The Kingdom's dysfunction is your opportunity.

## The Factions

### The Kingdom

The governing authority - a sprawling bureaucratic monarchy that means well and governs poorly.

- **Central power** in Kingsmoor (the capital)
- **Checkpoints** controlling movement between territories
- **Permit system** regulating trade, travel, and magic
- **Enforcement** that's inconsistent enough to make smuggling viable

The Kingdom isn't evil. They're the kind of rulers who start a war because it seemed heroic and can't understand why everything keeps getting worse.

*See: [[Kingdom]] for full details*

### The Enclave

The official magical authority that publicly enforces prohibition while privately running the black market.

- **Your employer** - You owe them, you work for them
- **Your supplier** - They provide ingredients (on credit, adding to debt)
- **Your jailer** - The tower is theirs, the debt is real, the receipts exist

They're organized crime with a government badge. Professional, documented, businesslike. They don't hurt people for fun - they hurt people because it's efficient.

*See: [[Wizards Enclave]] for full details*

### The Undead

A civilization that wants to be left alone, now defending itself against an unprovoked crusade.

They matter to you because their war creates opportunity - battlefield salvage, border chaos, war economy demand. You don't work with them or against them. You profit from the mess.

*See: [[Undead]] for full details*

### Independent Operators

Not monolithic factions, just people with their own interests:

- **Rebels** (Ashford) - Anti-Kingdom, will help you for a price
- **Independent Smugglers** (Riverton) - Neutral traders, competitors and sometimes allies
- **Various vendors** - Each with their own agenda and hidden stock

These relationships are transactional. Build reputation, unlock access, but don't expect loyalty.

## Your Place In All This

### How You Got Here

You took a smuggling job for the Enclave. Quick money, easy work. Something went wrong - caught, shipment lost, product destroyed. Now you owe them.

The debt isn't just money. It's leverage. You work for them now.

### What You Do

You're a wizard who runs a tower that's a front for contraband production. You:

- **Craft** magical goods at your tower
- **Smuggle** them through Kingdom checkpoints
- **Sell** to contacts across the region
- **Service your debt** while secretly building an escape fund

You're a middleman in supply chains, not the source. You buy ingredients through commerce (no gathering), craft products, and move them past people who'd rather you didn't.

### Your Goal

**Buy your freedom.**

Success isn't saving the world or defeating evil. It's accumulating enough wealth to:
- Pay off your debt (or escape it)
- Disappear or start over
- Get out of the smuggling game entirely

You're playing to escape, not to matter. The world is bigger than your story, and that's fine. You just want out.

## Tone & Themes

### Bureaucratic Dysfunction (Not Grimdark Tyranny)

This is **Papers Please**, not **1984**. The Kingdom means well. The Enclave is professional. Nobody's cackling in a dark tower. The world is broken because of incompetence, self-interest, and systems that outlived their purpose - not because of evil.

### Gray Morality

- The Enclave enforces prohibition while running the black market
- The Kingdom outlawed magic "for everyone's safety" as a power grab
- The Undead are victims defending themselves
- You're not a hero - you're surviving in a broken system

Nobody's right. Everybody's getting by. Including you.

### Small Player, Big World

You're not the chosen one. You're a specialist in an ecosystem:
- Other people make things you can't
- Other people have access you don't
- The war, the politics, the history - it all exists whether you engage with it or not
- Your goal is to escape, not to fix anything

The world doesn't revolve around you. That's what makes escape feel earned.

### Serious-Funny

Think Guy Ritchie, not Christopher Nolan. The situations are serious - debt, crime, war, survival - but the tone has room for dark humor, absurdity, and characters who are sharp rather than grim. The Undead withdrew and left a note. The royals started a war because crusades seem heroic. The Enclave keeps receipts because "this ain't the mafia."

Stakes can be real without everything being dour.

### Theme / Time-Period

**Medieval Economy, Prohibition-Era Crime**

The world operates at a medieval technological level - physical currency, horse-drawn transport, correspondence-based communication. But the *criminal organizations* have developed structures that feel anachronistically modern: documented transactions, professional hierarchies, systematic corruption, and leverage-based relationships.

This creates a specific tension: the Enclave runs their operation like a 1920s crime syndicate in a world where "running" means sending a rider with a sealed letter. They're unnervingly organized for their setting.

#### What Prohibition Means Here

The prohibition isn't about a substance being dangerous - it's about power consolidation dressed up as public safety. This shapes everything:

- **The illegality creates the value.** Mana, reagents, potions - none of these are inherently rare. They're valuable because they're banned. Remove prohibition, and your entire economy collapses. The Enclave knows this.
  
- **The crime is professional.** This isn't desperate people breaking laws to survive. It's an organization that treats illegal trade as a business with org charts, territories, and documented debts. "This ain't the mafia" - except it functionally is, just with better record-keeping.

- **Enforcement is selective.** The Kingdom can't actually stop magic use - they can only make examples and control chokepoints. This creates a world where *getting caught* matters more than *breaking the law*.

- **Everyone's complicit.** Guards take bribes. Officials look away. The Enclave has relationships everywhere. The system runs on controlled corruption.

#### Technology & Communication

**Mana crystals** power the few machines that exist - mostly engines and vehicles maintained by the Enclave and Kingdom (via Enclave expertise). These are rare, valuable, and tightly controlled.

**Communication** happens in person or via physical correspondence. No airwaves, no instant messaging. Documents matter:
- Permits (official Kingdom authorization)
- Notes (informal, deniable)
- Requests (Enclave assignments)
- Sealed Documents (tamper-evident, high-stakes)
- Forged versions of all the above

**Entertainment** once included magical performances - illusions, conjured spectacles, enchanted theaters. Much of this was lost to prohibition. What remains is underground, expensive, and risky.

#### Currency & Wealth

The Kingdom mints official coinage (copper, silver, gold) that serves as the universal medium of exchange. But wealth takes many forms, each with trade-offs:

| Form | Value Density | Liquidity | Checkpoint Risk |
|------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Copper/Silver | Low | Universal | Unremarkable |
| Gold coins | Medium | Universal | "Successful merchant" or "where'd you get this?" |
| Gems | High | Needs right buyer | "These look like Enclave payment..." |
| Trade goods | Variable | Market-specific | Plausible cover |
| Artifacts | Very high | Specialized | "Family heirloom, officer" |

**The Enclave runs credit internally** - they track what you owe, what you've paid, what you're worth. This is convenient but dangerous: they know exactly what you have.

**Your escape fund must be invisible.** Wealth the Enclave can see is wealth they can seize. The real game is converting visible earnings into hidden assets - gems sewn into wagon linings, artifacts "lost" in transit, gold buried somewhere only you know.

Physical wealth storage isn't primitive - it's operational security.

## Races & Demographics

### No Race-Based Stereotypes

All races coexist without segregation or race-specific cultures:
- No "elf wine" or "dwarf beer"
- No racial kingdoms or territories
- Regional differences come from geography and economics, not race

Potential Races:
- Dwarves
- Elves
- Goblins
- Humans
- Orcs

Undead?
It's also a Faction so maybe Undead is a version/variant of the others.

### Identity Comes From

- **Location** - Where you're from matters more than what you are
- **Faction** - Kingdom loyalist vs Rebel vs Enclave operative
- **Profession** - Smuggler, merchant, soldier, mage
- **Class** - Wealthy alpine merchants vs desperate border refugees

A dwarf from Snowmarch has more in common with a human from Snowmarch than with a dwarf from Ashford. Culture is place-based, not race-based.
