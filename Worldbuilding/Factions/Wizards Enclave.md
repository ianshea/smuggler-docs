# The Wizards Enclave

## Overview

The Enclave is the official magical authority of the Kingdom - a gray-area organization that publicly enforces magic prohibition while privately running the black market for magical goods.

They're organized crime wearing a government badge. And they're very, very good at it.

## The Arrangement

### Official Role

The Enclave exists because even a kingdom that outlaws magic needs magical expertise. Someone has to:

- Identify and confiscate magical contraband
- Handle magical accidents and incidents
- Advise on magical threats (like, say, a war with the Undead)
- Maintain the infrastructure of prohibition

The Kingdom can't do this themselves - they banned the training. So they tolerate the Enclave as a "regulated magical authority" operating in a legal gray area.

### Shadow Business

The Enclave's real business is **dealing in magic**.

They control the supply of magical goods through a distributed network of fronts, contacts, and operations. They don't just enforce prohibition - they profit from it. The same organization that confiscates contraband at checkpoints sells it out the back door in Thornhaven.

This isn't hypocrisy to them. It's vertical integration.

### Why It Works

Everyone who matters knows the arrangement. Nobody talks about it.

- **The Kingdom** needs the Enclave's expertise, especially during the war
- **The Enclave** needs the Kingdom's legal cover and enforcement infrastructure
- **Both sides** benefit from prohibition creating artificial scarcity

The Enclave could expose the fabricated treaty and destroy the Kingdom's founding mythology. They don't, because the current system makes them rich and powerful. Why burn down a building you own?

## How They Operate

### The Professional Approach

The Enclave isn't the mafia. They're more like the mafia if it kept impeccable records and had an HR department.

*"If a slap don't work, you either cut him or you pay him, but you keep the receipts cause this ain't the mafia."* - Rock'N'Rolla 

They document everything:
- Debts owed and payments made
- Inventory in and inventory out
- Who works for them and what they produce
- Infractions, punishments, and "adjustments"

This isn't bureaucracy for its own sake. **Leverage requires receipts.** You can't prove someone owes you if you didn't write it down. You can't blackmail effectively without documentation. The Enclave's archive in Thornhaven isn't just records - it's power in paper form.

### Network Structure

The Enclave operates through:

- **Thornhaven** - Their stronghold, where the real business happens
- **Tower operators** (like you) - Distributed production, plausible deniability
- **Front businesses** - Legitimate-looking shops that move product
- **Contacts in every city** - Eyes, ears, and hands everywhere
- **Corrupt officials** - Kingdom guards, inspectors, and bureaucrats on the payroll

No single point of failure. If one tower gets raided, the network continues. If one contact gets arrested, they don't know enough to matter.

### The Confiscation Pipeline

Here's the beautiful part: the Enclave runs enforcement AND supply.

1. Kingdom checkpoint confiscates magical contraband
2. Confiscated goods go to Enclave for "processing and disposal"
3. Enclave "disposes" of goods by selling them on the black market
4. Smugglers buy goods and try to move them
5. Some get caught at checkpoints
6. Return to step 1

They're not just profiting from prohibition. They've built a closed loop where they profit from *enforcement* of prohibition. The more effective the crackdown, the higher the prices, the more they make on both ends.

## Your Relationship With Them

### How You Got Here

You took a job for quick money. Something went wrong - you got caught, lost a shipment, owed for product you couldn't deliver. Now you're in debt to the Enclave.

The debt isn't just money. It's **leverage**. You work for them now.

### The Terms

- **They gave you a tower** - Enclave property, you're "renting" by working off debt
- **They supply your ingredients** - On credit, which adds to your debt
- **They expect production** - You make contraband for them to sell
- **They take a cut** - Of everything you earn
- **They inspect your operations** - To make sure you're not skimming

You're not an employee. You're not a partner. You're an asset with a balance sheet attached.

### Enclave Visits

The Enclave doesn't trust you. Why would they?

Periodically, your Enclave contact shows up at the tower. These visits serve multiple purposes:

- **Collection** - They take their cut of what you've produced
- **Resupply** - They drop off ingredients (on credit, adding to your debt)
- **Tasks** - They give you something to acquire and smuggle back for them

The tasks are the inverse checkpoint. Instead of smuggling contraband *out* past Kingdom guards, you're smuggling something *home* past them - and then handing it to the Enclave. 

**The calculus is simple:**
- Complete the task → You're a good asset, debt gets serviced, life continues
- Fail the task → Consequences (debt increase, punishment, loss of trust)

During these visits, you're also hiding any personal wealth you've accumulated. The Enclave expects their cut of *everything*. What they don't see, they can't take. But if they catch you holding out... that's a problem.

These visits are where narrative happens - new jobs, shifting Enclave priorities, warnings about Kingdom crackdowns, rumors from other parts of the network.

### What They Want From You

**Short term:** Production. You make goods, they sell goods, debt gets serviced.

**Long term:** A reliable node in their network. If you prove trustworthy (meaning: profitable and not too ambitious), you might get more responsibility, better supply access, harder jobs with better margins.

**What they don't want:** You getting ideas. You building independent relationships. You accumulating enough wealth to not need them.

Your goal (escape) is directly opposed to their goal (keeping you productive). They don't know your goal. Keep it that way.

## Enclave Culture

### Not Sadistic, Just Business

The Enclave doesn't hurt people for fun. They hurt people because it's efficient.

- Punishment is proportional and documented
- Rewards exist for good performance
- They prefer functional assets to broken ones
- Fear is a tool, not an end

This is almost worse than cruelty. A cruel boss you can hate. A businesslike boss who ruins your life through rational calculation? That's harder to process.

### The Hierarchy You Don't See

You interact with your Enclave contact. You might meet their supervisor. Beyond that, the organization is opaque.

Someone runs Thornhaven. Someone makes the big decisions. Someone has access to the archive with all those receipts. You don't know who, and you're not supposed to ask.

The Enclave rewards curiosity about magical formulas. It does not reward curiosity about Enclave structure.

### Loyalty Is Transactional

The Enclave doesn't inspire loyalty. They purchase it.

- Pay your debts, you're fine
- Be useful, you're valuable
- Become a liability, you're cut loose
- Betray them, you're an example

They won't come after you out of spite. They'll come after you because letting you go unpunished is bad for business. The receipts say you owe them. The receipts don't lie.

## Thornhaven

**Location:** Rolling hills and dense hedgerows (Normandy-style bocage terrain)

The Enclave chose this location deliberately. The terrain is a natural fortress - impassable hedgerows, sunken lanes, small enclosed fields. Armies have broken themselves on this kind of geography. The Kingdom can't easily project force here, which is why the Enclave can operate semi-independently.

**What's there:**
- Enclave administrative buildings
- Sanctioned alchemical laboratories  
- Training facilities (restricted)
- Official magical item registry
- The confiscation warehouse (where everything the Kingdom seizes ends up)
- The archive (where the receipts live)

**For you:** Thornhaven is where premium Enclave goods originate. Other Enclave supply is diluted, stolen, or marked up from what comes out of here. High risk, high reward. You work for them, so you have semi-legitimate access - but getting caught stealing from your own employer is catastrophic.

## What This Means For You

The Enclave is your employer, your creditor, your supplier, and your jailer.

They're not your enemy - you can't afford an enemy this powerful. They're not your friend - they don't have friends, they have assets. They're the cage you're trying to escape without them noticing you're escaping.

**Your advantages:**
- They need you productive (they won't destroy you without reason)
- They're predictable (follow the rules, work the margins)
- They're distracted (war economy means lots of balls in the air)
- They think you're beaten (ambition is the last thing they expect)

**Your constraints:**
- They watch you (inverse checkpoints, contacts reporting back)
- They control your supply (hard to operate without their ingredients)
- They own your home (the tower is theirs)
- They have receipts (your debt is documented and real)

The game is simple: produce enough to stay valuable, skim enough to build wealth, hide enough to avoid suspicion, and get out before they realize what you're doing.
