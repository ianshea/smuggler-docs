# The Kingdom

## Overview

The Kingdom is the governing authority over the land - a sprawling, bureaucratic monarchy that controls trade, enforces laws, and maintains order through checkpoints, garrisons, and an extensive permit system.

They're not evil. They're not tyrannical. They're just... not very good at this.

## Leadership

### The Current Royals

The King and Queen rule from Kingsmoor, the capital in the fertile plains. They are:

- **Well-intentioned** - They genuinely believe they're doing right by their people
- **Incompetent** - They don't understand the consequences of their decisions
- **Traditional** - They govern the way their ancestors did, because that's how it's done
- **Incurious** - They've never questioned the official history they inherited

They're not villains. They're the kind of rulers who start a war because it seemed like a good idea at the time, and who can't understand why things keep getting worse.

### The Crusade

The current royals decided to launch a holy crusade to "purge the Undead threat" - a threat that hadn't threatened anyone in living memory.

Why? Because crusades are what heroic kings do. Because the Undead are obviously evil (everyone knows that). Because it would unite the kingdom and cement their legacy.

They have no idea they're violating their own ancestor's fabricated treaty. They've never thought to question whether the treaty was real. They just... didn't think about it very hard.

## The Fabricated Treaty

### What People Believe

Hundreds of years ago, the Great Ancestor ended the Undead Wars through masterful negotiation. The treaty terms included:

- Prohibition of magic (which "caused the war")
- Establishment of the Enclave as the regulated magical authority
- Economic controls to prevent future conflicts
- Restrictions on necromantic materials and dangerous knowledge

The Great Ancestor saved the Kingdom through wisdom and diplomacy. Magic prohibition is the price of peace.

### What Actually Happened

The Undead just left. They were tired of the pointless cycle. They withdrew, left a note, and went into isolation.

The Great Ancestor saw an opportunity:

1. **Declared victory** - Claimed the withdrawal was a negotiated peace
2. **Blamed magic** - "Reckless sorcery caused and prolonged the war"
3. **Prohibited magic** - Eliminated rival power bases (independent mages, regional lords with magical resources)
4. **Created the Enclave** - Established a "regulated" magical authority under royal influence
5. **Implemented economic controls** - Monopolies, trade restrictions, and border controls dressed up as "treaty obligations"

Over generations, the lie became history. The current royals believe it completely.

### The Receipts

The Enclave knows the truth. They've kept records since the beginning - not out of principle, but because leverage requires documentation. Somewhere in Thornhaven, there's an archive that could unravel the Kingdom's founding mythology.

They don't use it. The current arrangement benefits them too much. But they have it.

## How the Kingdom Functions

### Governance Structure

- **Central authority** in Kingsmoor (capital)
- **Regional garrisons** in major cities (Snowmarch, Riverton, etc.)
- **Checkpoint network** controlling movement between territories
- **Permit system** regulating trade, travel, and (theoretically) magic
- **The Enclave** handling magical matters (publicly, enforcement; privately, whatever they want)

### Enforcement Philosophy

Magic prohibition is treated like traffic laws:

| Severity | Example | Consequence |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Minor infraction | Small-scale magic use, unlicensed cantrips | Warning or fine |
| Moderate infraction | Unlicensed potion possession, minor contraband | Larger fine, confiscation |
| Major infraction | Concealed high-grade contraband, magical "accidents" | Prison time |
| Severe violation | Necromancy, forbidden formulas, attacking guards | Extended imprisonment or worse |
| Capital offense | Demon-touched materials, mass casualties | Execution |

Enforcement is inconsistent. It depends on who catches you, where you are, and how much you can pay. This inconsistency is what makes smuggling viable.

### The War Economy

The crusade has strained the Kingdom's systems:

- **Increased demand** for magical supplies (combat magic, healing, war materials)
- **Disrupted trade routes** near the front lines
- **Checkpoint chaos** as resources shift toward the war effort
- **Refugee populations** creating new economic pressures
- **Greater reliance on the Enclave** (which the Kingdom can't publicly acknowledge)

The war is expensive, unpopular with those who have to fight it, and shows no signs of ending. But the royals can't admit they made a mistake, so it continues.

## Relationship to Other Factions

### The Enclave

Official position: The Enclave is the Kingdom's regulated magical authority, operating within the law to manage necessary magical functions.

Reality: The Kingdom depends on the Enclave and can't admit it. The Enclave exploits this dependency ruthlessly. Both sides maintain the fiction because it benefits them.

The Enclave enforces prohibition publicly while running the black market privately. The Kingdom knows (at some level) but can't act without losing their only source of magical expertise - especially during a war.

### The Undead

Official position: Ancient evil, defeated by the Great Ancestor, now resurgent and requiring a holy crusade to purge.

Reality: A civilization that wanted to be left alone, now defending itself against unprovoked aggression.

The royals genuinely believe they're the heroes of this story.

### Independent Operators (Rebels, Smugglers)

Official position: Criminals undermining the Kingdom's lawful order.

Reality: Inevitable consequence of a system built on artificial scarcity and inconsistent enforcement. The Kingdom creates the conditions for smuggling, then acts surprised when smugglers appear.

## What This Means For You

The Kingdom is your obstacle, not your enemy.

- **Checkpoints** are what you navigate around, through, or past
- **Guards** are who you bribe, deceive, or avoid
- **Permits** are what you forge or acquire
- **The law** is what you're breaking (but so is everyone else who matters)

You're not fighting the Kingdom. You're not trying to reform it. You're just trying to survive in the cracks of a system that was built on a lie and is now falling apart under the weight of a stupid war.

The Kingdom's dysfunction is your opportunity. That's the only relationship that matters.
