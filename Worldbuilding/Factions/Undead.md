# The Undead

> **Design Note:** Keep the Undead as background texture, not developed content. They explain *why* the world is the way it is, but they're not a faction the player interacts with directly. Resist the urge to flesh them out further until there's a gameplay reason.

## What You Need to Know

**They just want to be left alone.**

That's it. That's the whole thing.

The Undead aren't an invading horde, a dark empire, or a existential threat. They're a civilization (of sorts) that occupies territory the living don't want, doing whatever it is the Undead do when nobody's bothering them. 

They fought a long, grinding war generations ago - not to conquer, but because the Kingdom kept pushing into their territory. 

### Why They Stopped

War is pointless for the Undead.

Human kills Undead. Undead kills Human. Human becomes Undead. Undead fights former comrades. Repeat forever. The living kept throwing bodies at a problem that just made the problem bigger.

The Undead leadership - who don't die, or at least learned not to after a few early losses - had the luxury of perspective. One of them, after living through generations of this grinding cycle, finally decided: the humans aren't getting it. They're never going to get it. This will literally go on forever unless we just... stop.

So they withdrew. All of them. And they left a note.

(What the note said is lost to history. The Kingdom claimed it was terms of surrender. It was probably something like "You win! Don't follow us.")

The Kingdom declared glorious victory.

## The Current Conflict

The current King and Queen, in their well-intentioned incompetence, decided to launch a holy crusade to "purge the Undead threat" - a threat that hadn't threatened anyone in centuries.

The Undead are now defending themselves. Again.

They're not interested in conquest or revenge. They'd stop fighting tomorrow if the Kingdom stopped attacking. But the Kingdom won't stop, because the royals don't understand (or won't admit) that they started this.

## Gameplay Relevance

The Undead matter to you because their war creates opportunity:

- **Battlefield salvage** floods the black market (Death-Touched Steel, Bone Dust, Necrotic Distillate)
- **Border chaos** at Ashford Crossing means weak enforcement
- **War economy** increases demand for magical goods the Kingdom officially bans
- **Desperate refugees** create cheap labor and sellers

You don't work with the Undead. You don't work against them. You profit from the chaos their defensive war creates.

## Future Possibility (Not Now)

If the Undead ever become direct gameplay content, possibilities include:

- A hidden contact point for acquiring unique goods
- Missions into contested territory
- Learning the true history of the "treaty"

But that's later. Maybe never. For now, they're the reason Ashford is a lawless opportunity zone, and that's enough.
