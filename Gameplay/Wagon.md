# Wagon

Your wagon is your mobile operations center—transport, cargo storage, and enchantable platform for smuggling magic.

---

## Two-Crystal System

The wagon runs on a dedicated **Wagon Crystal** that powers locomotion only. This is separate from your **Personal Crystal**, which powers your spells.

| Crystal | Location | Powers | Recharge |
|---------|----------|--------|----------|
| Wagon Crystal | Mounted in wagon | Movement only | Tower (full efficiency) |
| Personal Crystal | Carried by wizard | All spellcasting, including smuggling enchantments | Tower only |

**Emergency Transfer:** If the wagon crystal runs dry in the field, you can transfer mana from your personal crystal to the wagon at a poor ratio. This gets you moving but depletes your spellcasting reserves—a desperation move, not a strategy.

The wagon crystal is essentially a specialized battery. Not everyone is a smuggler; most wagon owners just use theirs for transport. What makes yours special is what you do with magic on top of it.

## Cargo & Compartments

The wagon has compartments for storing cargo. These compartments are **enchantable**—you cast obscurement spells on them to hide contraband from checkpoint detection.

### Key Distinctions

- **Compartments are physical storage** - They hold goods, legal or otherwise
- **Obscurement is magical** - You cast spells to make compartment contents harder to detect
- **You power the magic** - Enchantments on compartments run off your personal crystal, not the wagon's
- **Spells have duration** - Obscurement isn't permanent; it's a countdown that can run out at bad times

This means smuggling isn't about mechanical hidden panels—it's about your wizard abilities. Detection at checkpoints is magical, and you're countering with magical concealment.

### Cargo Separation

Wagon cargo is separate from personal inventory:

- **Personal inventory** - Tools, consumables, your crystal, documents you're carrying
- **Wagon cargo** - Bulk goods, contraband, trade items

You can't hide contraband on your person and walk through a checkpoint. The wagon is where the goods go, and the wagon is what gets searched.

> **TODO:** Resolve whether cargo management is spatial (tetris packing) or slot-based (weight/capacity limits). See [[Unsorted_Ideas#Inventory & Wagon Design (UNRESOLVED)]].

## Upgrades

Wagon upgrades fall into categories:

| Category | Examples | Effect |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Capacity** | Larger bed, additional compartments | More cargo space |
| **Compartment quality** | Reinforced compartments, specialized storage | Better base for enchantments, certain goods require certain storage |
| **Crystal efficiency** | Improved wagon crystal mounting | Better mana-to-distance ratio |
| **Speed/Durability** | Wheels, axles, frame | Travel time, wear and tear |

Progression isn't just "bigger wagon"—it's improving the platform you're casting magic on.

> **TODO:** Define specific upgrades and costs.

## Wagon at Checkpoints

When you reach a checkpoint, the wagon is what guards inspect. The encounter becomes a contest between:

- **Their detection** - Spells, devices, trained inspection
- **Your obscurement** - Enchantments you've cast on compartments

Factors that matter:
- Quality/power of your obscurement spell
- Time remaining on the spell (did you cast it fresh, or is it about to expire?)
- Guard thoroughness (varies by checkpoint, events, bribes)
- What you're hiding (some contraband is harder to obscure than others?)

> **TODO:** Define the actual checkpoint mechanics—stat check? Interactive? See [[Checkpoints]].
