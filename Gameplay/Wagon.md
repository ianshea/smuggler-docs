# Wagon

Your wagon is how you transport cargo between locations. It has its own equipment, upgrades, and inventory separate from your personal gear.

> **TODO:** This system needs design work. See [[Unsorted_Ideas#Inventory & Wagon Design (UNRESOLVED)]] for current thinking.

## What We Know

- Wagon is the primary cargo container for smuggling runs
- Has its own interface/tab separate from personal inventory
- Can be upgraded (hidden compartments, speed, capacity, etc.)
- Interacts with [[Checkpoints]] (guards search it, concealment matters)
- Powered by [[Mana Crystals]] for travel

## Open Questions

- Is cargo management spatial (tetris packing) or slot-based (weight/capacity limits)?
- How do hidden compartments work mechanically?
- What upgrades are available?
- Does the player physically load/unload or is it abstracted?
