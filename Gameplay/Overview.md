The player, a member of the [[Wizards Enclave]], takes over management of a Wizard's Tower. 

The player manages their [[Tower]] - a front for the creation and distribution of [[Legal Goods]] and [[Contraband]] goods throughout the realm. The player will gather [[Resources]], [[Knowledge]], [[Artifacts]] and [[Tools]] used in crafting goods and creating [[Spells]] and [[Enchantments]] to [[Smuggling]] goods through [[Checkpoints]] to fulfill requests to earn [[Wealth]].

**Long Term Player Goal**
Amass wealth to escape or overthrow the Wizards Enclave.
### Core Mechanics

#### Logistics/Inventory
Containers hold Packages and Items
Packages hold stacks of items.
Some containers like Backpacks can be equipped to provide Inventory.
Pouches/Belts hold quick use items.

#### Smuggling
Players will use there Tower, Skills, Spells and Abilities to obscure packages from detection at checkpoints. Success means passing a checkpoint, failure means loss of resources and goods and can result in player death.

#### Combat
The player should be equipped with some potent and extremely dangerous offensive spells. Violence is bad for business and frowned upon by the Enclave, but it might be useful if one can get away with it.

#### Magic
Magic is powered by Mana. It is the core resource in the game. Spells require mana to cast, and Enchantments require a source of mana to function. The player has a limited amount of Mana. Mana Crystals can store Mana but can also be contraband.

#### Crafting
The player will  use crafting stations in the tower to craft magical items and contraband goods to smuggle. The player will acquire various resources, and stations through interactions with factions. The player will **not** focus on cultivating and harvesting resources.



### Core Loop

The player moves goods from their tower, or other locations through checkpoints. The player must return to their tower to regenerate mana.

Tower > Craft > Smuggle > Reward > Smuggle > Tower
