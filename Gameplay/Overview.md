# Gameplay Overview

This is the mechanical heart of the game - what you do and how you do it.

For story and world context, see [[World Overview]].

## Core Loop

```
Tower → Craft → Smuggle → Sell → Return → Tower
```

1. **Tower** - Craft contraband, prepare spells, plan your run
2. **Smuggle** - Move goods through [[Checkpoints]] to destinations
3. **Sell** - Deliver to [[Contacts]], get paid
4. **Return** - Get back to the Tower to regenerate mana and craft more

You must return to your Tower to regenerate mana. How you spend mana in the field (spells, travel) vs. what you keep for the return trip is a core tension.

## Core Mechanics

### Smuggling

Move [[Contraband]] and [[Legal Goods]] through [[Checkpoints]] to buyers.

- Use spells, skills, and equipment to hide contraband from detection
- Use [[Documents]] to bypass or ease inspections
- Navigate [[Guards]] through deception, bribery, or avoidance

Success = delivery and payment. Failure = confiscation, fines, or prison.

See [[Smuggling]] and [[Checkpoints]] for details.

### Failure & Consequences

Getting caught at a checkpoint means prison. The [[Wizards Enclave|Enclave]] bails you out - but it counts as a strike.

| Strike | What Happens |
|--------|--------------|
| 1 | They rough you up. Warning delivered. |
| 2 | Rough you up, take your stuff, increase scrutiny on future visits. |
| 3 | Game over. |

See [[Unsorted_Ideas#Failure States (DECIDED)]] for full details.

### Magic

Magic is powered by **Mana**.

- [[Spells]] require mana to cast
- [[Enchantments]] require a mana source to function
- [[Mana Crystals]] store mana for travel and field use
- You regenerate mana at your Tower

Mana economy creates the core tension: spend it in the field, and you might not have enough to get home.

See [[How Magic Works]] for details.

### Crafting

Use stations in your Tower to create magical goods and contraband.

- Acquire ingredients through **commerce** (no gathering/farming)
- Learn [[Formulas]] to unlock new recipes
- Stations determine what you can craft

See [[Unsorted_Ideas#Crafting Stations Beyond Potion Distiller]] for current thinking.

### Combat

You have access to potent offensive spells. Violence is:
- Bad for business
- Frowned upon by the Enclave
- Useful if you can get away with it

Combat is an emergency option, not a primary playstyle.

## Player Goal

**Buy your freedom.**

You're in debt to the Enclave. Success means accumulating enough hidden wealth to:
- Pay off your debt (or escape it)
- Disappear and start over

You're not trying to overthrow anyone or save the world. You're trying to get out.
