# Contraband

Contraband is any goods that are illegal, restricted, or controlled. The severity level determines the risk and the penalties if caught.

## Contraband Levels

| Level | Severity | What It Means | Example Penalties |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **0** | Legal | Not contraband, no restrictions | None |
| **1** | Minor Infraction | Questionable, suspect, dubious | Warning, small fine |
| **2** | Restricted | Regulated, monitored, controlled | Fine, confiscation |
| **3** | Prohibited | Blacklisted, illicit | Large fine, confiscation, possible prison |
| **4** | Illegal | Outlawed, forbidden | Prison (strike), major fine |
| **5** | Capital Offense | Maximum penalties | Prison (strike), severe consequences |
| **6** | Kill on Sight | Cursed, damned, demon-touched, necromancy | Immediate hostility, no negotiation |

## Flavor Labels

Different terms for the same levels - useful for item descriptions and worldbuilding:

| Level | Alternative Labels |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Questionable, Suspect, Dubious |
| 2 | Regulated, Monitored, Restricted |
| 3 | Blacklisted, Illicit |
| 4 | Outlawed, Forbidden |
| 5 | (Capital offense - no euphemisms) |
| 6 | Cursed, Damned, Demon-Touched, Necromantic |

## Gameplay Implications

- Higher level = higher profit margins (scarcity + risk = value)
- Higher level = worse detection consequences
- Level 6 items are "shoot first" territory - guards won't negotiate
- [[Guards]] with different traits react differently (a Greedy guard might overlook Level 2, a Zealot won't overlook Level 1)

## Design Notes

- Contraband level is a tag on items, not a separate inventory
- Same item might have different levels in different contexts (e.g., Fuzzy Leaf is Level 0 in the capital with a permit, Level 2 without)
- Detection difficulty is separate from contraband level (something can be highly illegal but easy to hide, or mildly restricted but magically detectable)
