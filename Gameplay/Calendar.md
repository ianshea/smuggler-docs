# Calendar

The calendar provides structure, texture, and hooks for the game world. It's not a pressure system—the debt is the pressure. The calendar is how time passes and the world moves around you.

---

## Purpose

The calendar serves several functions:

| Function | What It Does |
|----------|--------------|
| **Structure** | Regular beats that organize play sessions |
| **World rhythm** | The setting feels alive, things happen whether you act or not |
| **Planning hooks** | You can anticipate events and prepare for them |
| **Narrative delivery** | Scheduled moments where story advances |
| **Variety** | Conditions change, keeping runs from feeling repetitive |

The player controls their own pacing within this structure. The calendar tells you what's happening in the world; you decide how to respond.

## Calendar Elements

### Enclave Visits

The anchor of the calendar. Regular scheduled visits where:

- **Payment is due** - Debt updated, player sees progress (or lack thereof)
- **Assignments delivered** - New jobs, opportunities, complications
- **Narrative happens** - Story beats, world updates, Enclave politics
- **Tension maintained** - Even when you're doing well, their visit is never comfortable

Enclave visits function like Stardew's season changes—chapter markers where the game says "here's what's different now."

### War Events

The crusade against the Undead creates periodic disruptions:

- **Troop movements** - Routes close or become heavily patrolled
- **Battles** - Aftermath creates salvage opportunities, supply disruptions
- **Supply shortages** - Certain goods spike in price, demand shifts
- **Refugee flows** - Population movements, new contacts, changed checkpoint dynamics
- **Kingdom desperation** - As war goes poorly, enforcement might tighten or loosen unpredictably

War events shift the risk/reward landscape. A route that was safe last week might be crawling with soldiers; a checkpoint that was strict might have skeleton crew because guards got reassigned.

### Contact Availability

Not every buyer is available every day:

- **Market days** - Some contacts only appear on specific days
- **Travel schedules** - Contacts move between locations
- **Demand cycles** - What they want to buy changes over time
- **Reputation gates** - Higher-reputation contacts might have stricter availability

This creates a scheduling layer: "I need to get this shipment to Riverton by Marketday, or I wait another week."

### Seasonal Shifts

Seasons change the world:

| Season | Effects |
|--------|---------|
| **Winter** | Mountain passes close, travel slows, heating goods valuable |
| **Spring** | Roads muddy, flooding possible, planting season (legal goods cover) |
| **Summer** | Peak travel, busy checkpoints, festivals and events |
| **Autumn** | Harvest floods market with legal goods (great cover), pre-winter stockpiling |

Seasons affect travel, economy, and what kind of cover stories are plausible.

### Special Events

Irregular events that create temporary conditions:

- **Dignitary visits** - Heightened security, different inspection protocols
- **Festivals** - Crowds, distracted guards, or increased patrols depending on the event
- **Crackdowns** - Kingdom announces anti-smuggling push, checkpoints get serious
- **Enclave operations** - Sometimes they're moving something big, and you're either helping or staying out of the way

Special events are hooks for variety and narrative. They're announced in advance (usually) so the player can plan around them.

## Day/Night Cycle

Time passes within each day:

### Day
- Checkpoints fully staffed
- Most contacts available
- Better visibility (for everyone)
- "Normal" conditions

### Night
- Skeleton crews at some checkpoints
- Certain contacts only meet after dark
- Reduced visibility (helps concealment, but also harder to read situations)
- Different risks (bandits? Enclave operations? Or just quiet roads?)

Day/night isn't a hard shift in difficulty—it's a different set of conditions to read and plan around.

---

## Weather

Weather affects travel and encounters:

| Weather | Effects |
|---------|---------|
| **Clear** | Normal travel speed, no modifiers |
| **Rain** | Slower travel, guards less thorough (miserable and rushing), mud on roads |
| **Fog** | Concealment bonus, but also reduced awareness of surroundings |
| **Storm** | Significant delays, potential route closures, checkpoints might close or reduce staff |
| **Snow** | Winter only, major travel impact, some routes impassable |

Weather is another factor to read and incorporate into planning. Bad weather isn't just an obstacle—it might be an opportunity.

## Design Notes

The calendar should feel like **texture**, not **tyranny**:

- Events are generally announced in advance
- Missing an opportunity isn't catastrophic (another will come)
- The player can choose to ignore the calendar and operate on their own schedule—they'll just miss some optimal windows
- Pressure comes from debt and strikes, not from calendar deadlines

Think of it as the world having its own rhythm that you can sync with or work around.
