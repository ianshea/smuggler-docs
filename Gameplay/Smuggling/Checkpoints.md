# Checkpoints

Checkpoints are where smuggling happens. They're the Kingdom's control points between territories—and the obstacle between you and getting paid.

---

## Overview

Checkpoints exist on roads between locations. To move cargo from one place to another, you go through checkpoints.

At a checkpoint:
- Guards inspect your wagon, documents, and cargo
- You use spells, skills, bribes, and equipment to get contraband through
- Success = delivery and payment
- Failure = confiscation, arrest, strike
