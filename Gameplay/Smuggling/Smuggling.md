# Smuggling

You move [[Contraband]] and [[Legal Goods]] through [[Checkpoints]] to [[Contacts]].

---

## How It Works

1. **Load your [[Wagon]]** with goods at the Tower (or pick up cargo elsewhere)
2. **Travel** to your destination, passing through checkpoints
3. **Navigate inspections** using concealment, deception, bribes, or documents
4. **Deliver** to contacts and get paid
5. **Return** to the Tower before you run out of mana

## At Checkpoints

[[Guards]] will attempt to find your contraband through:
- Physical searches (Cunning vs Cunning)
- Magical detection (Arcana vs Arcana)
- Questioning (Cunning vs Intuition)
- Document verification

Your tools:
- **Hidden compartments** in your wagon
- **Concealment spells** (costs mana)
- **Forged or legitimate [[Documents]]**
- **Bribes** (costs gold, requires Moxie, depends on guard traits)
- **Legal cargo as cover** (hide contraband inside legitimate goods)

See [[Guards]] for how contests work.

## Success & Failure

**Success:** You pass the checkpoint with your cargo intact. Deliver, get paid.

**Failure:** Guards find your contraband.

Consequences:
- Contraband confiscated
- Fines (gold penalty)
- Prison → Enclave bails you out → counts as a **strike**

Three strikes and you're out. See [[Overview#Failure & Consequences]] for the full breakdown.

## The Tension

Every run is a risk/reward calculation:
- Higher [[Contraband]] levels = more profit, but harsher penalties if caught
- More cargo = more money, but harder to hide
- Using spells = better concealment, but depletes mana you need to get home
- Bribes = safer passage, but cuts into profits
