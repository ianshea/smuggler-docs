# Contacts & Vendors

Contacts are the people you do business with. Vendors sell goods; contacts buy your cargo, provide services, or offer jobs. Building relationships unlocks better deals and hidden inventory.

---

## Vendor System

### Two-Tier Inventory

Every vendor has two inventories:

| Tier | Access | Contents |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Public/Front** | Anyone | Legal or mundane goods |
| **Hidden Stock** | Reputation required | Contraband, rare items, faction goods |

The shopkeeper's smile gets warmer as your reputation grows—and the back room opens up.

### Unlocking Hidden Stock

Reputation unlocks through:
- Completing faction-related jobs
- Consistent trading (volume builds trust)
- Story progression (key events)
- Specific unlock conditions per vendor

## Vendor Properties (To Define Per Vendor)

Each vendor in [[Locations]] needs:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Public inventory** | What anyone can buy |
| **Hidden inventory** | What unlocks at each faction level |
| **Pricing structure** | Markup, regional differences |
| **Restock mechanics** | Daily? Weekly? Quest-triggered? |
| **Special services** | Information, storage, introductions |

## Contacts vs Vendors

| Type | Function | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Vendor** | Sells goods to you | Shopkeepers, suppliers |
| **Buyer** | Purchases your cargo | Fences, collectors, faction quartermasters |
| **Broker** | Connects you to jobs/info | Tavern contacts, information dealers |
| **Service** | Provides non-goods services | Forgers, wagon mechanics, storage |

Some NPCs fill multiple roles.

## Buyer Relationships

Contacts have **Requests** that can be fulfilled in return for payment or favors.

### Request Types

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Standing orders** | "I always need Ghost Caps" |
| **One-time requests** | "Find me a specific artifact" |
| **Urgent needs** | Time-limited, premium prices |
| **Faction jobs** | Missions that build reputation |

### Fulfillment

Completing requests:
- Pays in gold, items, or [[Wealth]]
- Builds relationship with that contact
- May unlock new requests or hidden stock
- Can affect faction reputation

## Open Questions

- How many reputation levels per faction? (5 shown above, but is that right?)
- Do individual vendors have separate rep from their faction?
- Can you lose reputation? How?
- Are there exclusive relationships (helping one faction hurts another)?
