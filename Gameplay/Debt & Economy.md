# Debt & Economy

The debt system creates the core pressure of the game. You owe the Enclave. Everything you do is shaped by that debt — and by your secret goal to escape it.

## The Numbers

### Starting Position

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Starting Debt** | 10,000 gold |
| **Enclave Cut** | 25% of visible earnings |
| **Escape Fund Target** | 5,000 gold (hidden wealth) |

### Strike Penalties

| Strike | Debt Increase | Other Consequences |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Strike 1** | +1,000 gold | Warning, roughed up |
| **Strike 2** | +2,000 gold | Stuff taken, increased scrutiny |
| **Strike 3** | Game over | — |

---

## Two Win Conditions

### Path A: Pay Off Debt

**Target: 0 debt**

- Pay the full 10,000 gold (plus any accumulated penalties)
- Enclave takes their 25% cut of everything visible
- Slower path — you're playing by their rules
- "Honest" ending — you're free, legitimately

### Path B: Escape

**Target: 5,000 hidden wealth**

- Accumulate wealth the Enclave can't see
- Risk: if they catch you hoarding, consequences
- Faster path — but you're always looking over your shoulder
- "Freedom" ending — you disappear with your stash

### Path C: Hybrid

- Pay down debt while also skimming
- Hedge your bets
- Keep options open until you commit to an ending

## Per-Run Economics

### Act I (Learning Phase)

| Metric | Typical Value |
|--------|---------------|
| Cargo capacity | 8 slots |
| Bundle value (low-tier) | 50-100 gold |
| Gross revenue | ~500 gold |
| Ingredient cost | ~200 gold (40%) |
| Enclave cut (25% of 300 net) | ~75 gold |
| **Your profit** | ~225 gold |

### Scaling by Act

| Act | Profit/Run | Runs in Act | Total Earnings |
|-----|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Act I** | ~225 gold | ~20 runs | ~4,500 gold |
| **Act II** | ~500 gold | ~25 runs | ~12,500 gold |
| **Act III** | ~1,000 gold | ~20 runs | ~20,000 gold |

**Total potential earnings: ~37,000 gold**

This allows for:
- Paying off 10,000 debt
- Building 5,000 escape fund
- Upgrades (wagon, staff, stations)
- Setbacks (failed runs, strike penalties)
- Player choice in how to allocate

## Enclave Economics

### What They See

The Enclave tracks:
- Jobs you complete for them
- Sales you make (through their network)
- Ingredients you buy on credit

They take **25% of visible earnings** — meaning anything you sell through normal channels, they get a cut.

### What They Don't See

Hidden wealth:
- Gems "lost in transit"
- Gold stashed outside the tower
- Artifacts as "decorations"
- Wealth held by other factions (for a fee)

**The game within the game:** How much can you skim without them noticing?

### Credit System

Buying ingredients on credit adds to your debt:
- Item cost + 20% markup
- Convenient, but deepens the hole
- Enclave profits whether you succeed or fail

## Debt Dynamics

### Debt Increases From

| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Strike penalties | +1,000 / +2,000 |
| Ingredients on credit | Item cost + 20% |
| Station purchases | Variable (major investments) |
| Enclave "favors" | Variable (story events) |

### Debt Decreases From

| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Visible profits | Revenue - costs - 25% cut |
| Direct payments | Lump sum if you have cash |
| Enclave jobs | May include debt reduction |

### No Interest

Debt doesn't grow on its own — keeps the math simple and the pressure manageable. The Enclave makes money off your labor, not compounding interest.

(Strike penalties serve as the "punishment for failure" mechanic instead of interest.)

## Strategic Implications

### Early Game (Act I)

- Every run matters — 225 gold profit is meaningful
- Can't afford many mistakes
- Temptation to skim is high (progress feels slow otherwise)
- Learning which risks are worth taking

### Mid Game (Act II)

- Profits scale up, debt feels more manageable
- Upgrades become affordable
- Enclave scrutiny increases (you're successful now)
- Decision point: commit to payoff or escape?

### Late Game (Act III)

- High-value runs, high stakes
- If escaping: need to hide wealth aggressively
- If paying off: sprint to zero debt
- Enclave watching closely either way

## Hidden Wealth Mechanics

### How to Hide Wealth

| Method | Risk | Capacity |
|--------|------|----------|
| Don't report a sale | Medium | Unlimited (but suspicious if too much) |
| "Lose" gems in transit | Low | Small amounts |
| Tower decorations | Low | Medium (artifacts as decor) |
| Faction holds it | Medium | Variable (they charge fees or favors) |
| Physical stash | Low | Unlimited (but can't easily access) |

### How They Catch You

- Enclave inspections (periodic tower visits)
- Discrepancies in records vs lifestyle
- Informants (other smugglers, contacts)
- Bad luck (wrong place, wrong time)

### Consequences of Getting Caught Hoarding

TBD — but should be severe without being game-ending:
- Confiscation of found wealth
- Debt increase (penalty)
- Increased scrutiny (harder to hide future wealth)
- Strike? (maybe, if severe)

## Sample Progression

### Conservative Player (Pay Off Path)

| Point | Debt | Hidden | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Start | 10,000 | 0 | — |
| End Act I | 7,000 | 0 | Steady progress |
| End Act II | 2,000 | 0 | Light at end of tunnel |
| End Game | 0 | 0 | Free, legitimately |

### Aggressive Player (Escape Path)

| Point | Debt | Hidden | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Start | 10,000 | 0 | — |
| End Act I | 9,000 | 1,500 | Skimming hard |
| End Act II | 8,000 | 4,000 | Almost there |
| End Game | 7,500 | 5,000+ | Escape triggered |

### Unlucky Player (Setbacks)

| Point | Debt | Hidden | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Start | 10,000 | 0 | — |
| Strike 1 | 11,000 | 500 | Caught early |
| End Act I | 10,500 | 1,000 | Barely treading water |
| Strike 2 | 12,500 | 1,500 | Hole getting deeper |
| End Act II | 9,000 | 3,000 | Recovered, but scarred |
