The Enclave gave you a home, of sorts, showed you the ropes. You proved savvy and they helped you learn a bit more about how to help the organization. They sent you away, to get a proper education and some connections.

Congratulations. You've done well. Welcome home, now the fun is over, you get responsibility.

You must earn for the Enclave.
