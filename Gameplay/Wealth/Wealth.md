# Wealth

Wealth isn't an abstract number — it's physical items you must transport, hide, and protect. This creates risk on the return journey, not just the outbound smuggling run.

---

## Core Concept

You smuggle contraband *out* to buyers. You smuggle wealth *back* to your tower.

Both directions have checkpoints. Both directions have risk. The return trip isn't free.

## Forms of Wealth

Wealth comes in different forms, each with trade-offs:

| Form | Value Density | Liquidity | Checkpoint Risk | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Copper/Silver** | Low | Universal | Unremarkable | Day-to-day spending money |
| **Gold coins** | Medium | Universal | Moderate | "Successful merchant" or "where'd you get this?" |
| **Gems** | High | Needs right buyer | High | "These look like Enclave payment..." |
| **Trade goods** | Variable | Market-specific | Low | Plausible cover cargo |
| **Artifacts** | Very high | Specialized | Variable | "Family heirloom, officer" |

### Why This Matters

- **Low-value wealth is safe but bulky** — A bag of silver under your seat draws no attention, but you need a lot of it
- **High-value wealth is compact but suspicious** — Gems are easy to hide physically, but raise questions if found
- **The Enclave tracks visible wealth** — They know what you're paid, what you owe, what you're worth

## Wealth and Checkpoints

### Outbound

Guards care about **contraband**. Your cargo is the risk. Wealth you're carrying (to buy supplies, pay bribes) is secondary.

### Return

Guards care about **visible wealth**. Your cargo compartments might be empty of contraband, but now they're full of payment.

| Guard Trait | Effect on Return |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Greedy** | Very interested in your gold |
| **Lazy** | Won't dig through your wagon |
| **Sharp** | Notices wealth you thought was hidden |
| **Loyal** | Doesn't care about your gold, only contraband |

A greedy guard at a return checkpoint might:
- Demand a "tax" (bribe)
- Get suspicious about where the wealth came from
- Trigger a more thorough inspection

### Exit Checks

Some checkpoints trigger inspections when you're *leaving* a city, not just entering. This is where return-trip wealth matters most.

## Wealth Visibility

Not all wealth is equally visible:

| Visibility | Examples | Detection |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| **Obvious** | Chest of gold, heavy coin purse | Guards see it immediately |
| **Noticeable** | Gold coins in main bed, gem pouch | Found on casual search |
| **Hidden** | Gems in underseat storage, gold sewn into lining | Requires thorough search |
| **Obscured** | Wealth in magically concealed compartment | Requires detection magic |

**Strategic choice:** Do you spend mana obscuring wealth on the return trip? Or save mana and hope your compartment's natural hiddenness is enough?

## The Enclave Problem

The Enclave tracks your finances:
- They know what jobs you did
- They know what you got paid
- They take their cut (debt payments)
- They can seize visible assets

**Your escape fund must be invisible.** Wealth the Enclave can see is wealth they can claim.

### Hiding Wealth from the Enclave

- **Gems "lost" in transit** — Reported as stolen, actually stashed
- **Artifacts as "decorations"** — Tower furnishings that hold value
- **Buried caches** — Physical hiding spots only you know
- **Faction relationships** — Rebels might hold wealth for you (for a fee, or favor)

The Enclave doesn't raid your tower constantly, but they do "inspect" periodically. Visible gold is documented. Hidden wealth is freedom.

---

## Wealth as Inventory

Wealth items follow the same rules as other items:

- **Personal inventory** — Small amounts (coin purse, a few gems) carried on your person
- **Wagon compartments** — Larger amounts transported as cargo
- **Tower storage** — Where you accumulate your escape fund

Wealth items can occupy wagon slots. A chest of gold takes a slot. Gems might stack more efficiently.

---

## Economic Flow

```
Sell contraband → Receive wealth (items)
        ↓
Transport wealth back (risk)
        ↓
Arrive at tower
        ↓
Choice: 
  - Visible wealth → Enclave sees, takes cut, counts toward debt
  - Hidden wealth → Escape fund grows, but harder to spend
```

**The tension:** Visible wealth pays down debt (good), but Enclave knows exactly where you stand. Hidden wealth buys freedom (eventually), but you're still making debt payments from visible income.

---

## Wealth Progression

| Act | Typical Wealth Forms | Enclave Scrutiny |
|-----|---------------------|------------------|
| **Act I** | Copper, silver, small gold | Low — you're small-time |
| **Act II** | Gold, gems, trade goods | Medium — you're successful |
| **Act III** | Gems, artifacts, large sums | High — they're watching |

As you become more successful, the Enclave pays more attention. Your escape fund needs to grow faster than their scrutiny.
