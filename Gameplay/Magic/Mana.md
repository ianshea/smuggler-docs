# Mana

Mana powers all magic. It exists in three forms, each tied to different magical applications and crafting systems.

---

## Mana Forms

| Form | Source | Primary Use | Crafting Station |
|------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Crystal** | Mined from deposits | Spells (active casting via personal crystal) | — (used directly) |
| **Liquid** | Harvested from Mana Ponds | Potions | Potion station |
| **Powder** | Processed/refined | Scrolls, Enchantments | Scroll station, Enchanting station |

Obtaining different mana types and their corresponding crafting stations unlocks different production capabilities.

## Acquisition

You acquire mana through **commerce**, not gathering:

- Buy from suppliers (legal or black market)
- Enclave provides some on credit (adding to debt)
- Trade with contacts who have access to sources

The Enclave controls most mana infrastructure (mines, ponds, processing). Independent sources exist but are rare, expensive, or risky.

## Mana and Prohibition

Mana itself isn't strictly illegal—the *use* of magic is. But:

- Large quantities raise suspicion ("Why does a merchant need this much mana?")
- Certain refined forms are controlled substances
- Possession implies intent to use (or sell to users)

Mana is contraband-adjacent. Having it isn't automatically criminal, but it invites scrutiny.
