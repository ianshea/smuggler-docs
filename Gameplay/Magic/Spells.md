# Spells

Spells are your active magical tools during smuggling runs. Limited preparation slots force meaningful choices about your loadout before leaving the Tower.

## The Spellbook

### Spellbook as Consigliere (FLAVOR DIRECTION)

The player's spellbook isn't just a menu—it has personality. Think of it as a consigliere that:

- Gives advice (helpful or questionable)
- Manages your spell loadout
- Provides flavor commentary on your choices
- Maybe has its own agenda?

This adds character to what would otherwise be UI. Fits the Guy Ritchie tone—a mouthy magical book that's seen some shit.

**Open questions:**
- How much personality? Sarcastic advisor vs full NPC?
- Does it have opinions on your moral choices?
- History with previous owners?
- Can you upgrade/replace the book, or is it a constant companion?

## Spell Preparation

### Capacity

| Stat | Starting | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Prepared slots** | 5? | TBD - expand through progression |
| **Swap location** | Tower only | Spell Management Station |

You choose your loadout before leaving. Wrong loadout = adapt or struggle.

### Preparation Strategy

Consider your route and anticipated challenges:
- What checkpoints will you hit?
- What's your cargo risk level?
- Return trip—will you be carrying visible wealth?

## Spell Categories

### Utility (5-10 mana)

Low-cost, frequent use. The bread and butter.

| Spell | Cost | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| *TBD* | | Light, minor detection, small tricks |

### Obscurement (15 mana)

Core smuggling magic. Hides compartment contents from inspection.

| Spell | Cost | Duration | Effect |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| **Basic Obscurement** | 15 | ~8-10 min | Hides one compartment from magical detection |

See [[Mana Economy]] for duration mechanics and timing strategy.

### Moderate (20-30 mana)

Situational power. Use when utility isn't enough.

| Spell | Cost | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| *TBD* | | Charm, enhanced concealment, social manipulation |

### Emergency (25-40 mana)

Last resort. Expensive, but gets you out of bad situations.

| Spell | Cost | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| *TBD* | | Combat, escape, major intervention |

## Spell Acquisition

### Learning Spells

1. Find or buy a **Formula Scroll** (physical item)
2. Load scroll at **Spell Management Station** in Tower
3. Spell permanently added to spellbook
4. Preparation slots determine which spells are *active*

### Learnable vs Cargo-Only

| Tier | Can Learn? | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Novice | Yes | Starting spells |
| Journeyman | Yes | Mid-game unlocks |
| Master | No | Too advanced—smuggle only |
| Archmage | No | High-value contraband |

Master/Archmage scrolls are valuable trade goods you can't use yourself. Creates interesting cargo decisions.

## Component Requirements (MAYBE)

Some powerful spells might require consumed components beyond mana:

- Makes high-tier spells feel like crafting decisions
- Limits spam of powerful magic
- Example: Teleport needs rare catalyst

**Open question:** Does this add strategic depth or just inventory hassle?
