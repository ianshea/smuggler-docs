# How Magic Works

Magic is powered by mana and regulated by prohibition. You're a wizard operating in a world where your abilities are illegal—and essential to your survival.

## Mana

Mana is the fuel for all magic. It exists in three forms, each tied to different magical applications:

| Mana Form | Source | Primary Use |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Crystal** | Mined from deposits | Spells (active casting) |
| **Liquid** | Harvested from Mana Ponds | Potions |
| **Powder** | Processed/refined | Scrolls, Enchantments |

These forms connect to crafting stations—having the right mana type and the corresponding station lets you produce different magical goods.

### Mana as Stamina

Your **Personal Crystal** functions like a stamina bar for field operations:

- You leave the tower with a full crystal
- Every spell you cast depletes it
- Spells have **duration/countdown**—they're not permanent
- When it's empty, you can't cast
- Recharge only happens at your tower

This creates the core tension: **spend mana in the field, and you might not have enough to get home** (or to keep your obscurement spells running through a long checkpoint line).

The mana crystal isn't a regenerating RPG mana pool. It's a finite resource you take into the field and must manage across an entire smuggling run.

## Towers as Mana Infrastructure

You can only recharge your crystal at your tower. This isn't arbitrary—towers are built on mana sources (ponds, ley lines, or other infrastructure) that enable regeneration.

The Enclave controls the towers. This means:

- **They control recharge points** - You can't operate independently without access to a tower
- **They know where you live** - Your tower is your leash
- **They own the infrastructure** - The mana source beneath your tower belongs to them

"Buying your freedom" isn't just paying off debt—it's escaping a system where they control the resource you need to function as a wizard.

## Types of Magic

### Spells

Active magic cast by the wizard, powered by your personal crystal.

- **Combat spells** - Offensive/defensive magic (emergency use only)
- **Utility spells** - Light, detection, minor effects
- **Smuggling spells** - Obscurement, illusion, concealment (your bread and butter)

Spells have duration. An obscurement spell cast on a wagon compartment isn't permanent—it's a countdown. If the checkpoint line takes longer than expected, your spell might expire at the worst moment.

*See [[Spells]] for specific spells.*

### Potions

Consumable liquids that create effects on the drinker. Crafted from liquid mana at a potion station.

- Buff/debuff attributes
- Temporary effects
- Applied to self (not throwable combat items)

*See [[Potions]] for details.*

### Scrolls

Consumable items that release a spell effect when used. Crafted from powder mana.

- Single-use spell delivery
- Can create effects you couldn't cast yourself
- Valuable contraband (forbidden knowledge in portable form)

*See [[Scrolls]] for details.*

### Enchantments

Permanent or semi-permanent magical effects applied to items. Created using powder mana.

- Wagon compartment obscurement upgrades
- Equipment enhancements
- Require a mana source to remain active (your personal crystal powers wagon enchantments in the field)

*See [[Enchantments]] for details.*

### Wands

Single-use spell items. War surplus, not part of your regular toolkit.

- One-off consumables used by soldiers
- Exist in the economy as contraband/trade goods
- You don't carry or use them—you might smuggle them

## Magic and Prohibition

Magic is illegal. The Kingdom banned it centuries ago under the false pretense of a treaty with the Undead. The Enclave was established as the "regulated" magical authority—publicly enforcing prohibition while privately running the black market.

What this means for you:

- **Using magic is risky** - Getting caught casting is as bad as getting caught with contraband
- **Magical goods are valuable** - Illegality creates the market
- **Detection is magical** - Checkpoint guards use spells/devices to find contraband; you counter with obscurement
- **The Enclave profits from both sides** - They supply you, regulate magic, and take a cut of everything
