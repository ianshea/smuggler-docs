# Mana Crystals

Mana crystals are the portable power source for spellcasting. Your personal crystal is your "stamina bar" in the field.

## Personal Crystal

Your mana reserve, housed in your **Staff**. Powers all spellcasting.

- **Capacity** - Determined by staff quality (starting: 100 mana)
- **Depletion** - Spells, lifting bundles, and other magic drains it
- **Recharge** - Only at your tower
- **Upgrade path** - Better staff = larger crystal = more capacity

When it's empty, you can't cast. Managing your crystal charge across a smuggling run is a core skill.

### Staff as Mana Container

The crystal isn't a separate inventory item — it's part of your equipped staff. This means:

- Upgrading your staff upgrades your mana capacity
- Your staff is your casting implement (used with your Spellbook)
- Losing your staff would be catastrophic (don't lose your staff)

## Wagon Crystal

A dedicated crystal mounted in your wagon. Powers locomotion only.

- **Separate from personal** - Doesn't power your spells
- **Recharges at tower** - Same as personal crystal
- **Emergency transfer** - You can drain personal → wagon at poor ratio if stranded

The wagon crystal is essentially a specialized battery for movement. What makes your wagon special for smuggling is the magic *you* cast on it, not the crystal that moves it.

## Crystal Economy

Crystals are:
- **Mined** - Crystal mana comes from deposits
- **Enclave-controlled** - They control the supply and the recharge infrastructure
- **Your leash** - You can't operate without access to tower recharge

The Enclave doesn't need to chase you down. They just need to control the crystals and the towers. Without recharge, you're stuck.
