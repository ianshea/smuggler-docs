# Mana Crystals

Mana crystals are the portable power source for spellcasting. Your personal crystal is your "stamina bar" in the field.

## Personal Crystal

The crystal you carry. Powers all your spellcasting.

- **Capacity** - How much mana it holds (upgradeable?)
- **Depletion** - Every spell cast drains it
- **Recharge** - Only at your tower

When it's empty, you can't cast. Managing your crystal charge across a smuggling run is a core skill.

## Wagon Crystal

A dedicated crystal mounted in your wagon. Powers locomotion only.

- **Separate from personal** - Doesn't power your spells
- **Recharges at tower** - Same as personal crystal
- **Emergency transfer** - You can drain personal → wagon at poor ratio if stranded

The wagon crystal is essentially a specialized battery for movement. What makes your wagon special for smuggling is the magic *you* cast on it, not the crystal that moves it.

## Crystal Economy

Crystals are:
- **Mined** - Crystal mana comes from deposits
- **Enclave-controlled** - They control the supply and the recharge infrastructure
- **Your leash** - You can't operate without access to tower recharge

The Enclave doesn't need to chase you down. They just need to control the crystals and the towers. Without recharge, you're stuck.
