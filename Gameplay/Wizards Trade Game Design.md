  - Transporting goods (legal and illegal) between settlements.
  - Using magic for smuggling and enhancing gameplay.
  - Upgrading equipment (e.g., spellbook, staff) and the tower.
  - Faction relations and consequences.
- **Narrative Themes**: Mafia-style intrigue, prohibition-era inspiration, and moral choices with impactful consequences.
