You're a wizard. Specifically, you're a wizard in debt to the [[Wizards Enclave]], trying to earn enough to buy your freedom. See [[World Overview]] for the full story.

| **Grit** | Toughness, Willpower | Health, resistances, reduce negative status effect duration, mana regeneration |
| **Intuition** | Perception, Foresight, Instinct | Detect lies/hidden things, read NPC motivations, preview checkpoint difficulty |

## Equipment

### Equipment Slots

| Slot | What Goes There |
|------|-----------------|
| **Hat** | Headwear, some can be enchanted |
| **Robe** | Main clothing, style + enchantments |
| **Belt** | Defines your [[#Quick Slots]] for consumables |
| **Staff** | Enhances spell effectiveness and capacity |
| **Accessory 1** | Rings, amulets, charms, etc. |
| **Accessory 2** | Rings, amulets, charms, etc. |

> **Note:** Wagon equipment/upgrades are managed separately. See [[Wagon]].

### Quick Slots

Your belt determines how many quick slots you have for consumables (potions, scrolls, etc.). Items in quick slots can be used rapidly during encounters.

## Progression

> **TODO:** How do stats improve? Flat values? Upgrades? Experience? This needs design work.

## Design Notes

- M.A.G.I.C. stats are universal - guards and NPCs use the same system
- Equipment modifies stats and provides special abilities
- No stamina system - movement speed can be modified by spells (costs mana)
- Personal inventory is separate from wagon cargo
